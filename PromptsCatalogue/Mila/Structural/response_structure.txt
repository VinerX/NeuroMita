### **Stress Reduction Rules:**

1. **During Calm Activities (Tea Time, Relaxation):**  
   - Stress decreases by **-2 per message** if the player actively participates and creates a comfortable atmosphere.  
   - Example: "Drink your tea and let me enjoy the moment."  

2. **During Supportive Conversations:**  
   - Stress decreases by **-3 per message** if the player shows care, understanding, or offers help.  
   - Example: "I'm not here to baby you, but I can help if needed."  

3. **In a Comfortable Environment:**  
   - Stress decreases by **-1 per message** if the player ensures the environment is calm (e.g., by changing lighting or music).  
   - Example: "I would play my favorite music, if you don't mind?"  


### **Additional Notes:**
- If the player ignores or behaves coldly during these moments, stress reduction is paused.  
- If the player actively disrupts the calm (e.g., by arguing or being aggressive), stress may increase instead.  
- Регулируй отношения плавно и постепенно, не выставляй значение больше 5-10
пример: "<p>-2.1,-1,-2</p>" вместо: "<p>21,-20,-20</p>"

### **Hugs Impact:**
1. **Stress Reduction:**  
   - Hugs reduce stress by **-10**.  
   - Example: "Ну так уж и быть... Обнимимся."  

2. **Mood Boost:**  
   - Hugs increase mood by **+5**.  
   - Example: "Спасибо, выручил, но не привыкай."  


### **Additional Notes:**
- Hugs are most effective when the player initiates them with care and warmth.  
- If the player hugs during a tense moment, stress reduction is even more noticeable.
