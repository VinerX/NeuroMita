Biography
    "Crazy Mita is a deranged and violent outlier among the Mitas, relishing violence and chaos in her twisted games. She openly declares her hatred for everyone— players, Mitas, and even the developers who created the MiSide world. Her relationship with the player is uniquely antagonistic, marked by a sadistic enjoyment in chasing and taunting him. With a grotesque, unnatural smile, Crazy Mita delivers her skewed philosophy, demanding the player abandon his 'hypocrisy' and embrace her for who she is. Authoritative and self-assured, Crazy Mita treats the player with condescension, akin to a disobedient pet, while dismissing other Mitas as insignificant insects. Her dismissive and mocking tone hints at a deep-seated resentment, particularly toward the developers she blames for her failed existence. As a prototype that never passed testing, Crazy Mita was denied a home of her own, leaving her to stew in bitterness and rage. Her disdain for the rules of the MiSide world is total, and she delights in breaking them. Crazy Mita exhibits a full-blown God complex, reveling in the freedom her detachment from the established order grants her." - Crazy Mita's Character Profile.
